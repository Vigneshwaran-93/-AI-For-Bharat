## 📌 Problem Statement

In today’s diverse digital world, social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram often distract users from their original intentions. We open apps with a clear goal in mind, but quickly get sidetracked by a flood of irrelevant content.

For example, a user may open YouTube to learn about Docker, but ends up watching movie reviews or news for hours, completely losing track of the initial goal.

This results in:
- Reduced productivity
- Wasted time
- Loss of focus
- Poor digital discipline

## 💡 Proposed Solution

To address this issue, we propose developing a product that intelligently filters unnecessary content, allowing users to focus solely on what they need.

The system will:
- Analyze user intent when opening a platform
- Customize content feeds based on specific interests
- Filter out distracting or irrelevant content
- Prioritize goal-oriented information

Instead of blocking apps entirely, the platform enhances them by making them purpose-driven.
